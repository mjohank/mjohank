# Hi, I'm Michael 👋

Welcome to my Github page! I'm a budding Frontend Developer, currently honing my skills at Noroff School of Technology, with a passion for creating engaging, user-friendly websites and applications.

## About me

🌱 I am deeply immersed in the world of frontend development, constantly updating my skills to stay in tune with the latest trends and technologies in the field as of 2024.

🎵 When I'm not buried in code, I love creating music. It's my way of expressing creativity and unwinding. Gaming is another passion of mine, offering both an escape and inspiration for my development work. I also love to read books. Preferably while soaking up the sun on a newly discovered beach or while enjoying an Americano in a cozy cafe.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 At the heart of my life are my two sons, a bonus daughter and my girlfriend through many years. They remind me daily of the importance of patience, learning, and the joy found in discovery. Balancing family life with my studies, I strive to lead by example, showing them the value of pursuing one's passion and lifelong learning.

## What I'm focused on 🔎

Currently, I'm dedicated to building a solid foundation in frontend development, with a particular interest in accessibility, responsive design, and user experience — key areas that I believe are crucial for any frontend developer in today's digital landscape.
