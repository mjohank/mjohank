## A bit more About me

- 🌱 Learning and growing: I am deeply immersed in the world of frontend development, constantly updating my skills to stay in tune with the latest trends and technologies in the field as of 2024.
- 🎵 Passions beyond code: When I'm not buried in code, I love creating music. It's my way of expressing creativity and unwinding. Gaming is another passion of mine, offering both an escape and inspiration for my development work.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 At the heart of my life are my two sons and a bonus daughter. They remind me daily of the importance of patience, learning, and the joy found in discovery. Balancing family life with my studies in Haugesund, I strive to lead by example, showing them the value of pursuing one's passion and lifelong learning.

## What I'm focused on

Currently, I'm dedicated to building a solid foundation in frontend development, with a particular interest in accessibility, responsive design, and user experience — key areas that I believe are crucial for any frontend developer in today's digital landscape.
